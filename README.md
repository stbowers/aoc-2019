# Advent of Code 2019 - (https://adventofcode.com/2019)

This is my code for the 2019 Advent of Code, which is a coding puzzle game structured like an advent calendar, where every day of December leading up to the 25th there is a new puzzle to solve.
The purpose of this is as an exercise of the mind, and a fun coding challenge.

Most of the code is written in Rust (and maybe Python).

Each day is set up by running the script
```
./setup_day.sh
```
which contains some code to create a new Cargo project with a basic setup, and also downloads the input file for the challenge. (downloading the input requires a text file named `.aocsession` with the session key)
